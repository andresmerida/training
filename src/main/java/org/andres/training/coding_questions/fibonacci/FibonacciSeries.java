/**
 * In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
 * Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š.
 * The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1,
 * although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2.
 * Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins[1]
 * 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....
